This folder contains tools for backing up the rpi.  Rpi SD cards become corrupt pretty frequently, especialy when power cycling is happening, so it's important to back up often.

This system is taken more or less literally from:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/5427/can-a-raspberry-pi-be-used-to-create-a-backup-of-itself

The steps to backup:
1)  Insert an external hard drive via USB  (thumb drive, SD, whatevs)
2)  mount it at /mnt/usbhd
3)  run ./do_backup.sh

The steps to restore (I think....):
1)  Make a new raspian lite SD card, (I don't think it has to be fresh as long as the boot sector works),
2)  On an external unix-running computer:
3)  mount it
4)  Run this command:

rsync -vraH /mnt/usbhd/raspberrypi-backup/ /

and then cross your fingers and pray

Here's how you mount:
Put in an SD card with a big partition of type ext3
  Use fdisk -l to id it, make sure it has a large ext3 partition *
  sudo mkdir /mnt/usbhd
  sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/usbhd




  If it's not type ext3, use fdisk to clear out a partition, then mkext2 (I think?) to make it ext3
