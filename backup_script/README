This folder contains tools for backing up the rpi.  Rpi SD cards become corrupt pretty frequently, especialy when power cycling is happening, so it's important to back up often.

This system is taken more or less literally from:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/5427/can-a-raspberry-pi-be-used-to-create-a-backup-of-itself

The steps to backup:
1)  Insert an external hard drive via USB
2)  mount it at /mnt/usbhd
3)  run ./do_backup.sh

The steps to restore (I think....):
1)  Make a new raspian lite SD card, (I don't think it has to be fresh as long as the boot sector works),
2)  On an external unix-running computer:
3)  mount it
4)  Run this command:

rsync -av --delete-during /mnt/usbhd/pi_backup/ /mnt/sdcard_partition2/
